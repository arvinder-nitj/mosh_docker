# Linux Command Line

## Linux distributions

Linux is an open-source OS. Therefore, many development communities have built their our custom versions of it. We call them *Linux distributions* or *Linux distros* for short. Some of the most popular are:

- Ubuntu (the one we'll use here)
- Debian
- Alpine
- Fedora
- CentOS

The commands are mostly the same for all of them.

## Running Linux

Head on to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com) and search for **ubuntu**.

![ubuntu](img/01_ubuntu.png)

Click on the image card and DockerHub will redirect you to its page. Here you can find the `docker pull` command to download this image into your computer. In this case that is simply `docker pull ubuntu`.

![ubuntu pull](img/02_ubuntu_pull.png)

If instead you run `docker run ubuntu`, docker will first check if the image is locally available. If it is, it will run it. If it is not, it will pull it and then run it.

![ubuntu run](img/03_ubuntu_run.png)

To check which containers are running we run:

``` shell
docker ps
```

![docker ps](#img/04_docker_ps.png)

The `ubuntu` image is not being used in any of our containers and is therefore not shown. If we want to display all containers (running or otherwise), we need to add the `-a` flag (which stands for *all*):

``` shell
docker ps -a
```

![docker ps a](img/05_docker_ps_a.png)

If we need to start a container in the interactive mode we need to add the `-it` flag, as well as the name of the image to run:

``` shell
docker run -it <image_name>
```

![docker run it](img/06_docker_run_it.png)

What we have done is to open a shell in the container. This shell is not waiting for our commands. The first part of the prompt says that we are currently logged in as the `root` user. Following that comes the name of the machine. So user `root` is at (`@`) machine ID `52c9f9d3cb53`. After the colon (`:`), the forward slash (`/`) represents where we are in the file system. In this case, we are at the root directory. Lastly, the pound sign (`#`) means that we have the highest levels of privileges. If we had logged in as a regular user we use see a currency sign (`$`).

Some commands that we can use are:

- `echo` to print something to the terminal
- `whoami` will display the user name
- `echo $0` will display the location of the shell program
- `ls` will display all directories
- `history` will display a list of all the commands that we've run
- with `!#` where `#` is a number from the history, we can re-run that command

## Managing packages

In Ubuntu we manage packages with `apt` (*Advances Package Tool*). If we run `apt` in the container, we can get a list of all the sub-commands that we can use

![apt](img/07_apt.png)

For example, we can use `apt list` to see the list of all available packages and their status.

![apt list](img/08_apt_list.png)

If we don't see the package that we need in that list, we can run `apt update` and the list will be updated from a predefined list of sources.

![apt update](img/09_apt_update.png)

To install a package we use.

``` shell
apt install <package_name>
```

![apt install nano](img/10_apt_install_nano.png)

Here we are installing `nano` which is a lightweight text editor for Ubuntu. To remove it we run:

``` shell
apt remove nano
```

![apt remove nano](img/11_apt_remove_nano.png)

## Linux file system

In Linux (just as with other OSs), files are organized in a tree. In Linux, everything is a file (including processes and directories). The root directory in Linux is just `/`. After that, standard directories include

- `bin` which includes all the binaries for that distro
- `boot` which includes all the files related to booting the system
- `dev` which is short for *devices* (not development) and includes all the files needed for accessing devices
- `etc` which is short for *editable text configurations* (not etcetera) and includes all the configuration files
- `home` which where all home directories (users) are stored
- `root` which is the home directory of the root user
- `lib` which is where software library dependencies are stored
- `var` which is short for *variable* and is where we store files that are update frequently (like logs)
- `proc` which is where we store files that represent running processes

``` txt
  /
  |_ bin
  |_ boot
  |_ dev
  |_ etc
  |_ home
  |_ root
  |_ lib
  |_ var
  |_ proc
```

## Navigating the file system

To navigate the files we need to use commands.

- `pwd` will *print working directory*
- `ls` will *list* the files in that directory. Some flags that we can add are:
  - `-1` for listing them one per row
  - `-l` for long listing (includes more details)
  - `<path>` will show the files in that path (without having to navigate to it)
- `cd` will *change directory*. We can use either relative or absolute paths:
  - relative paths are relative to the current working directory
  - absolute paths always start from the root `/`
  - `cd ..` will take us one level up in the tree
  - `cd ../..` will take us two levels up in the tree
  - `cd ~` will take us to the home directory of the current user

## Manipulating files and directories

- `mkdir` will create a new directory as a child of the current directory
- we use the `mv <current_location> <new_location>` to *move* a file or rename it
- `touch <file_name>` will create a new file
- `touch <file_name> ... <file_name>` will create all the files that we list
- `rm <file_name> ... <file_name>` will delete all the files that we list. We can also use patterns.
- `rm -r <directory_name>` will delete the directory and all its files

## Viewing and editing files

To view and edit files we can use `nano`. We open the file in nano by running.

``` shell
nano <file_name>
```

We ca Â¿n now make changes to the file in the text editor. To exit a file we press `control + x`.

To see the content of a file we run:

``` shell
cat <file_name>
```

`cat` is short for *concatenate* and we can use it to combine files. When viewing files, `cat` is only useful for short files. For longer files we use:

``` shell
more <path/to/file>
```

When using `more` we can scroll down one page at a time by pressing the space bar, or one line at a time with the enter key We can exit by pressing `q`. But we can only scroll down. If we want to be able to scroll both up and down we run:

``` shell
less <path/to/file>
```

When using `less` we can scroll both up and down by using the arrows. The space bar, enter and `q` still work with `less`.

To look just at the head of a file we can use the `head` command followed by `-n #` where `#` is the number of lines.

``` shell
head -n 5 <file_name>
```

Similarly, we can use `tail` to see the last `n` lines.

``` shell
tail -n 5 <file_name>
```

## Redirection

Tow basic concepts in Linux are

- Standard input => keyboard
- Standard output => screen

But we can change the sources of either input or output. This is referred to as *redirection*. For example, `cat file1.txt` will print the content of `file1.txt` to the screen. But we can redirect the output by using the redirection operator (`>`) and send it to `file2.txt`.

Similarly, we can use the `<` sign to redirect the standard input.

## Searching for text

To search for text in a file we use the `grep` command, which stands for *global regular expression*. This search is case sensitive. We use it by supplying a string pattern and a file name.

``` shell
grep Hello file1.txt
```

We can remove case sensitivity with the `-i` flag.

``` shell
grep -i hello file1.txt
```

We can search in multiple files by supplying multiple file names or by supplying a file name pattern.

To search in directories, we can supply a directory name, or use `.` to refer to the current directory with the `-r` flag.

## Finding files and directories

To find files and directories we use the `find` command. If we run it without any arguments, it will list all files and directories in the current directory recursively. To search somewhere else, we need to supply a path.

If we only want to list directories we need to add the `-type` option with the value of `d`:

``` shell
find -type d
```

Likewise, we can use the `f` value for only getting files:

``` shell
find -type f
```

We can add patterns. For example, to search for all files who's names start with `f` we use:

``` shell
find -type f -name "f*"
```

To make the search case insensitive we use:

``` shell
find -type f -iname "f*"
```

## Chaining commands

We can chain multiple commands with semi-colons (`;`).

``` shell
mkdir test; cd test; echo done
```

If we want execution to stop at the first error, we use the *and* operator (`&&`).

``` shell
mkdir test && cd test && echo done
```

Likewise, we can use an *or* operator (`||`)

``` shell
mkdir test || echo "directory exists"
```

We can also use piping (`|`) to chain command.

``` shell
ls /bin | less
```

We can write multi-line commands by using a backslash (`\`) and pressing enter.
