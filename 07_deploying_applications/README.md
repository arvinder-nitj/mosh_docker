## Deployment options

We have two deployment options:

- deploying to a single-host
- deploying to a cluster

Single-host deployment is simple and easy, but they don't scale up. Cluster deployment requires orchestration tools. Currently, the most popular orchestration tool is Google's Kubernetes.

## Virtual Private Server

To deploy our application we need a VPS. We can procure it from platforms like Digital Ocean, GCP, Azure, AWS, etc.
